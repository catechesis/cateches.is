I can hardly believe I'm typing these words.  It's 1:00 in the morning, and my hands are shaking.  My wife is fast asleep, but she could tell something was wrong all day.

Let me start by saying my first postmortem, "I crashed my BMW", went so well.  While I was disappointed to have to write it, the learning experience was phenomenal and I think everyone was the better because of it.  I was giddy watching the readers trickle in on Google Analytics, then pour in as my postmortem hit the frontpage of HN.  I had made it.  I even had the backing of one of the most presigious tech forums on the web!  The comments were fantastic; so supportive.

So when I wrote up my latest pm, I expected similar results.  I wrote up all the mistakes I'd made, all the things I learned, and I pressed submit.  Cmd+<TAB> to GA, and it's show time.  The readers trickle in.  First from Mountain View and San Francisco, then Sydney, then Bangalore and Oslo.  Cmd+<TAB>, refresh.  No karma.  This goes on for an hour.  I tense, my wife can tell something's wrong.  I can't bring myself to tell her I've failed, and I change the subject.  This is eating me up inside.  I'm off the first page of /newest and I know I'm done.  No comments, no social shares; I painfully delete the post.

So what went wrong?  I covered a lot of good points in "I Crashed my AMG":

  * Heliporting auto parts from western Germany to my bungalow in Lisbon didn't save as much money as I'd hoped compared to heliporting them from Munich.
  * I avoided the trouble of raising funds from larger institutions, like banks, by borrowing money from my family to pay for it.

But there's no point belaboring the points I've already made in my previous postmortems.  Instead I'll focus on why I think my lessons learned weren't as appreciated as they should have been.

 * I guess I don't know my audience as well as I should.  Many of the commenters on my original postmortem seemed very familiar with BMW, Volvo, and other more eastern European makes.  There was almost no talk of more western makes, like AMG or Peugot.
 * Availability was also an issue.  I had to leave my keyboard to get dinner, which means I wasn't always ready to answer a question about my crashed AMG or comment on how it differed from my previous BMW.

There may have been a host of other reasons why it failed.  It may have not been well written, I may have gone after the wrong market in my submission.  I may have used the wrong tone.  Was I too authoritative?  Keep reading though, my aunt works for quite a large bank and we're in the works of financing a Lotus!
